# Exploring Postfeminism Through Digital Tools
In this portfolio, I explore how digital tools can be used not just as creative outlets, but as a way to critically examine the technologies themselves. Throughout the semester, I used tools like Tracery, Bitsy, Twine, OpenProcessing, Google Earth, and Voyant to engage with my research on postfeminism and advertising. Rather than simply using these tools to create, I learned more about the biases, choices, and underlying assumptions that shape them—highlighting how technology is far from neutral. These tools, while often framed as “objective,” come with their own set of decisions and limitations that impact the outcomes. This portfolio reflects my effort to understand and critique how technology, and the decisions embedded within it, interact with issues of gender, identity, and media representation.

## Fevertising Comic/Zine
This comic critiques how brands use postfeminist language to sell empowerment. Through DIY production and a zine-like format, I explored how advertising reinforces the idea that women need products to feel confident. The narrative shifts from empowering ads to a woman rejecting these messages, highlighting the contradictions within femvertising.

## Postfeminism Ad Campaign using Twine
For my Twine project, I explored how creative teams navigate the challenges of making a feminist ad campaign. Through branching decisions, I examined the tension between empowerment and performativity in advertising. Twine’s interactive format helped me illustrate how creative decisions are shaped by stakeholder feedback, public reaction, and risk management in today’s cultural climate.

## Breaking the Glass Ceiling Game using Bitsy
For my Bitsy game, I wanted to highlight the challenges women face in career advancement. Through three floors—representing entry-level, mid-level, and leadership positions—players navigate career obstacles like microaggressions and gendered dynamics. The game offers an interactive way to experience these barriers firsthand, emphasizing that breaking the glass ceiling doesn’t resolve all workplace gender issues.

## Postfeminism Ad Generator using Tracery
For my Tracery project, I created an ad generator to critique the formulaic nature of postfeminist advertising. By filling in blanks with common advertising buzzwords, it highlights how ads often reduce empowerment to a product-driven, neoliberal message. The generator not only exposes the mechanical structure of these ads but also critiques how they perpetuate biases. This project shows how postfeminist language is co-opted for market logic, turning empowerment into a commodity.

## Playful Prose using OpenProcessing
For this, I created a dynamic text visualization to explore how femvertising co-opts feminist language for marketing. Words related to beauty, work, and activism move across the screen, fading and transforming to highlight the contradictions in "empowering" ads. The project critiques how these messages become background noise, reflecting the disconnect between marketing language and women's real experiences.
