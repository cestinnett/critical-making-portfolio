# Exploring Postfeminism Through Digital Tools
In this portfolio, I explore how digital tools can be used not just as creative outlets, but as a way to critically examine the technologies themselves. Throughout the semester, I used tools like Tracery, Bitsy, Twine, OpenProcessing, Google Earth, and Voyant to engage with my research on postfeminism and advertising. Rather than simply using these tools to create, I learned more about the biases, choices, and underlying assumptions that shape them—highlighting how technology is far from neutral. These tools, while often framed as “objective,” come with their own set of decisions and limitations that impact the outcomes. This portfolio reflects my effort to understand and critique how technology, and the decisions embedded within it, interact with issues of gender, identity, and media representation.
